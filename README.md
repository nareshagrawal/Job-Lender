# Job-Lender
Spring MVC and Hibernate project
# Description
* Developed a Spring MVC and Hibernate application for making job search easier through job portal where recruiters of different companies will post job openings and job seekers will search & apply to those jobs
* Implemented features for job seeker facilitating job recommendations and a functionality of withdrawing submitted job application, viewing applied jobs & searching for a job by various option 
* Incorporated Apache Commons Email API features and implemented a functionally to download applicant profile as a PDF using iText API & recruiter can see a list of applied candidates for the jobs 
* Utilized Log4J for logging all user and system actions and JUnit for testing the application before the iterative deployment
# Design & Considerations
* The project was built upon MVC framework(mainly Spring MVC) allowing for complete abstraction between the data model, the    controller/business logic and the view accessible to users
* No two user have same username & email id
* No two company have same company name
* Password must have one upper case, one lower case character and a number, at least of 4 and at most of 8 letters
# Running the application locally
* Once you have sucessfully downloaded the project, you can directly open and run the file in your Eclipse IDE
* To ensure a clean build, also install the Spring Tool Suite plugin and Hibernate plugin
